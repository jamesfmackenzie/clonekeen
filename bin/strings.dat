; ABOUT THIS FILE...
;
; This file contains string data for CloneKeen.
; Each string is prefaced with a string name, which is enclosed
; in square brackets. The next line after the string name
; is the first line of the string. The string data continues until
; another opening square bracket is seen.
;
; You can use a backslash to delimit special characters. A backslash
; followed by an open or close parenthese can be used to insert square
; brackets into the string text. A backslash followed by an uppercase H
; will turn on highlighting (text will appear red on a grey background).
; A lower case h will turn off highlighting (text will appear black on a
; white background). Two backslashes will result in a single backslash.
;
; You can specify numeric attributes for a string by adding them on to the
; same line as the string name after the closing bracket. For example this
; is used with strings defining text to go in dialog boxes to specify the
; dimensions of the dialog box.
